== ASEPRITE 0.9 ==

  * DONE ~~Resizable window~~.
  * DONE ~~Automatic check for updates~~.
  * DONE ~~Export/Import sprite sheets~~.

== ASEPRITE 0.9.1 ==

  * DONE ~~Copy/Paste/Selection/Transformation integration: Currently the "copy, paste, rotate & scale" workflow is unrelated with "select & move" feature. Should be possible to select a region and resize/rotate it (without the need to copy and paste)~~.
  * DONE ~~Integrate the paste operation with new transformation controller~~.

  * Projects management (settings per file, grid size, automatic sprite sheets import/export, etc.).
  * Implement [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling#RotSprite RotSprite] algorithm.

== ASEPRITE 1.x ==

  * Simplify multi-sprite editors handling: You should be able to drag & drop editors' tabs to split them horizontally or vertically (remove Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. shortcuts).
  * Add support for hotspots and "hot-rectangles".
  * Export/import files to/from XML+PNG (my_sprite.xml + my_sprite_files/**.png).
