== ASE 0.9 ==

  * Resizable window (already done in Git repository for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux).
  * Copy/Paste/Selection/Transformation integration: Currently the "copy, paste, rotate & scale" workflow is unrelated with "select & move" feature. Should be possible to select a region and resize/rotate it (without the need to copy and paste).
  * Shade drawing mode.
  * Export/Import sprite sheets.

== ASE 1.0 ==

  * Simplify multi-sprite editors handling: You should be able to drag & drop editors' tabs to split them horizontally or vertically (remove Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. shortcuts).
  * Create "Home" tab.
  * Add support for hotspots and "hot-rectangles".
  * Export/import files to/from XML+PNG (my_sprite.xml + my_sprite_files/**.png).
