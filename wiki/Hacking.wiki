#summary You should start reading this if you want to modify the source code.

=Hacking=

If you are here, is because you want to modify Aseprite source code to your own needs. The first thing to keep in main: checkout the `dev` branch. It's the branch we use to develop new features (and fix big issues that are planned for the next big release).

In `master` branch should be small fixes that should be release ASAP. In any case, you can send a pull request to `dev` branch, then I cherry pick the small fixes for `master`.

==Compiling==

First of all you need a working copy of Aseprite compiled with your own compiler. To this please see the [DevHelp] section.

==Directories==

The following is the way how files are organized in Aseprite's repository:

{{{
cmake/           Special modules for CMake.
data/            Data distributed with the binaries (xml, icons, images, skins, etc.).
docs/            Several .txt files (licenses, file formats) and the quickref.odt file.
misc/            Utility .sh scripts (generate ETAGS, generate new distribution, etc.).
src/             Aseprite source code.
third_party/     Third-party libraries.
CMakeLists.txt   Main CMake file to build all the project & third party libraries.
config.h
}}}

In `src/` there are several modules, each one with different dependencies, purposes, and licenses. See [https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/tree/dev/src/#aseprite-source-code src/README.md] for more information.
