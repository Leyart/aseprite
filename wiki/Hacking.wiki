#summary You should start reading this if you want to modify the source code.

=Hacking=

If you are here, is because you want to modify ASEPRITE source code to your own needs.

==Compiling==

First of all you need a working copy of ASEPRITE compiled with your own compiler. To this please see the [DevHelp] section.

==Directories==

The following is the way how files are organized in ASEPRITE's repository:

{{{
cmake/           Special modules for CMake.
data/            Data distributed with the binaries (xml, icons, images, skins, etc.).
docs/            Several .txt files (licenses, file formats) and the quickref.odt file.
misc/            Utility .sh scripts (generate ETAGS, generate new distribution, etc.).
src/             ASEPRITE source code.
third_party/     Third-party libraries.
CMakeLists.txt   Main CMake file to build all the project & third party libraries.
config.h
}}}

In `src/` there are several modules, each one with different dependencies,
purposes, and licenses:

{{{
src/
  allegro/       Customized Allegro library (from branch 4.4). This is not
                 in third_part/ because there are several changes.
  app/
  base/          Base library with general purpose functions.
  commands/
    filters/
  dialogs/       Legacy dialogs (mostly not used, they will be removed).
  file/          Routines to load/save image/animation files.
  filters/
  gfx/
  gui/
  modules/
  net/           Mini-wrapper of curl library to send HTTP requests.
  raster/        Base classes to manage sprites, layers, cels, images, etc.
  settings/
