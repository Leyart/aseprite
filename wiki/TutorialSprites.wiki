You can use ASEPRITE to create animated sprites, static [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game tiles], or just [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art pixel art]. Basically you can manipulate any kind of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_image raster graphics], where images are conformed by a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel grid of pixels], little squares distributed in a rectangular way. E.g. When you see a photo in your computer, you almost does not notice the existence of pixels (they are too small).

You can start creating a sprite with `File > New` menu option, or pressing `Ctrl+N` keyboard shortcut. In this dialog you select:
  * The `Width` and `Height` of the new sprite (in pixels). You can choose values from 1 to 9999 for each field.
  * The `Color Mode`, which basically says how many colors you will be able to put in the image.
      Note: With [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model RGB] images you can have an independent color for each pixel, in this way each little pixel has its Red, Green, Blue and Alpha (opacity) values. With [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_color Indexed] sprites have a special element associated: a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_(computing) palette] (with a maximum of 256 colors), in this way each pixel has a palette entry associated, if you change the palette color, all pixels associated to that color will change their aspect. For pixel art, your selection should be _Indexed_.
