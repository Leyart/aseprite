#summary Steps to do a new release.

= Release Steps =

Here we've a simple list of steps to create a new release. It's for the main distributor of packages, so generally you should not be reading this.

== Windows Package ==

  * Change the VERSION preprocessor definition in config.h to the new version. Commit this change to "master" branch.
  * Create a new _build-VERSION_ directory to compile this specific version. The compilation should include .pdb files so we can debug a memory dump in the future.
  * Execute cmake in that directory. Modify flags (replace /MD with /MT) to use static C++ runtimes.
  * Compile. If something fails, make a change and commit this change. Compile until it's everything ok.
  * Create the distribution package executing the misc/dist.sh script.
  * Test the package uncompressing and executing it.

== Publish ==

  * Upload packages to http://code.google.com/p/aseprite/downloads/entry
  * Update the ReleaseNotes page.
  * Create a blog entry with the main news.
  * Update the official site (http://www.aseprite.org/) with the new version.
  * Tweet the blog entry and create a post in Google+ linking the blog.
