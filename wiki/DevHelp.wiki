#summary Help for new developers.

== Getting the Source Code ==

If you want to help in ASEPRITE, first of all you will need a fresh copy of the Git repository. It is located in GitHub, here [https://github.com/dacap/aseprite github.com/dacap/aseprite].

On Windows you can use programs like [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ msysgit] or [http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/ GitExtensions] to clone the repository. You can clone it locally using the following command (read-only URL):

  git clone git://github.com/dacap/aseprite.git

Or you can clone it from [http://github.com/ GitHub] using the `Fork` button in [https://github.com/dacap/aseprite github.com/dacap/aseprite]. This can be useful if you want to maintain your own public branch.

== Building ASEPRITE ==

You need [http://www.cmake.org/ cmake] and a compiler to build ASEPRITE source code. You can found the instructions to build ASEPRITE in [https://github.com/dacap/aseprite/blob/master/INSTALL.txt INSTALL.txt] file.

The following is a list of tested environments where ASEPRITE is compiled successfully:

  * Windows + MSVC 2008 Express + DirectX SDK
  * Windows + MSVC 2010 Express + DirectX SDK
  * Linux + GCC
  * Mac OS X + GCC

You will not need any extra library, because the repository already contains the source code of all the dependencies, even a modified version of the Allegro library is included in `master` branch (it is not true for `0.8` branch).
