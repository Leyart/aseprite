==Why do I see double-sized pixels?==

Each ASEPRITE pixel uses 2x2 real pixels on the screen. It is designed in this way to reproduce look & feel of old sprite editors, and it is achieved only using this special configuration of pixels on the screen.

If you want to edit images with the full screen resolution, you've a workaround:
  # Close aseprite
  # Open `aseprite.ini` file (or `~/.asepriterc` on Mac OS X and Linux)
  # Find `ScreenScale = 2`
  # Replace with `ScreenScale = 1`
  # Save, close the file, and run aseprite again

==How do I move layers in the stack?==

You've to use the _Animation Editor_. To open it you can press the `Tab` key or `View > Animation Editor` menu.
